Sometimes images in PDFs are rotated (CTM) before display.
For example, add an image to a word document, rotate it in
the document, then create a PDF.  The image will display properly
in xpdf, but not when extracted using pdfimages.  xpdf applies
the included CTM, pdfimages doesn't.

I modified ImageOutputDev.cc to rotate images (ppm) extracted with pdfimages.
For reference I'm including a diff and copy of ImageOutputDev.cc.
A binary pdfimages built using this ImageOutputDev.cc is in dynapad/bin.
