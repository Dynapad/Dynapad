Install a newer Xft, otherwise freetype bogs down after zooming in and out
a few times.

  rpm -i xft-update-2.1.2-0.i386.rpm

Install more fonts.

  cd /etc/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts
  mv Type1 oType1
  tar xf fonts.tar
  fc-cache

If you haven't checked out dynapad yet, then

  cvs checkout dynapad
  cd dynapad
  ./configure
  make all

If configure fails to find your plt 200 directory, then use --with-plt=DIR
to pass your plt 200 directory to configure.  For example,

  cvs checkout dynapad
  cd dynapad
  ./configure --with-plt=/home/stanonik/plt
  make all

Linking of dynapad.so will generate complaints about unresolved references
to sch_xxxx functions.  These are okay ... probably.  See the README about
builtin.cpp if you want to know why.

If you have checked out dynapad and need to update it, then

  cd dynapad
  cvs update
  make all
