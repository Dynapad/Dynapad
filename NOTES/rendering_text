Some notes about rendering strings.

Pad_Object has three virtual rendering methods:
I thought I could use the Render method to decide when to
antialias freetype, but 

  Render()
  Render_medium()
  Render_fast()

Pad_Text has three levels (0-low res, 2-max res)
I thought I could use the level (2-max res) to decide when to
antialias freetype, but the level seems to always be 2 (max res).

Pad_Restorer has five modes:

Modes
  RESTORE_UNDEFINED  0
  RESTORE_NOW        1
  RESTORE_WHEN_IDLE  2
  RESTORE_REFINE     3
  RESTORE_RESTORE    4

Pad_Restorer also has refinementLevel (how far has refinement got).

Each Restorer "encapsulates a region (X Region)" that it restores.

What's the mapping from Restorer mode+refinementLevel to Object
Render method to Text level?


Panning is performed by scheme code that binds Run-B1-Motion to
a callback that does a Moveto; ie, panning is repeated Moveto's.
At the level of the Restorer, the result seems to be repeated NOW,
finished by REPAIR.  I modified Draw_string to render freetype
without antialiasing if the mode is NOW.  Because the last rendering
during panning uses REPAIR, freetype is rendered antialiased after
panning stops.

Zooming is performed by scheme code that starts and stops a timer,
whose callback does a Zoom_around, which calls Set_view; ie, zooming
is repeated Set_view's.  At the level of the Restorer, the result
seems to be repeated WHEN_IDLE.  So, freetype is always rendered with
antialiasing; ie, nothing is done for faster rendering during zoom.

Pan    NOW ... REPAIR
Zoom   WHEN_IDLE ...

Following a hyperlink calls Animate_to, which makes repeated calls
to Set_view.  At the level of the Restorer, the result seems to be
repeated NOW.  I modified Animate_to so that the final Set_view uses
WHEN_IDLE mode.  So, freetype is rendered without antialiasing during
animation and with antialiasing when animation ends.

Moveto WHEN_IDLE
Moveto NOW ... (when animated)
Which I changed to
Moveto NOW ... WHEN_IDLE (when animated)
so that I'd know when the move finished and can antialias

Set_view
  if ...
    Schedule RESTORE_NOW
    Schedule RESTORE_REPAIR
  else
    Schedule RESTORE_NOW 

Damage
  Schedule  RESTORE_WHEN_IDLE

I don't understand when RESTORE_REFINE occurs, because what I thought
should be REFINE of text, seems instead to be REPAIR.
