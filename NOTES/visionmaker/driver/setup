GENERAL
=======

This driver allows you to use certain GTCO/CalComp devices under Linux
with XFree86.

This document assumes you are familiar with configuring XFree86.

You should have received pre-compiled binaries. To build the driver
yourself, refer to the BUILD file in this archive.


INSTALLING
==========

-----------
XFree86 4.x
-----------

Copy the file gtcc_drv.o with the rest of the XFree86 input modules.
On many systems this will be /usr/X11R6/lib/modules/input.

You must edit your XF86Config file to support your tablet. Use the
following example when you edit your own XF86Config file:

##BEGIN COPY##

# You should already have a "ServerLayout" section!
Section "ServerLayout"
        # don't remove items already in this section!
        InputDevice     "Tablet"        "AlwaysCore"
EndSection

Section "InputDevice"
        Identifier      "Tablet"
        Driver          "gtcc"
        Option          "Device"        "/dev/ttyS0"
        Option          "Mode"          "Absolute"
        Option          "DataFormat"    "GTCO_Type5"
#       Option          "DataFormat"    "GTCO_CC"
#       Option          "DataFormat"    "Summa_MM"
#       Option          "DataFormat"    "Summa_UIOF"
#       Option          "EmulateMouse"  "yes" # default is no
#       Option          "BaudRate"      "19200" # default is 9600
        Option          "MaxX"          "12000"
        Option          "MaxY"          "12000"
EndSection

##END COPY##

-----------
XFree86 3.x
-----------

Please try to use at least version 3.3.3.1 of XFree86 because it has
several bug fixes relating to XInput.

Copy the file xf86GtcoCC.so with the rest of the XFree86 modules. On
many systems this will be /usr/X11R6/lib/modules.

You must edit your XF86Config file to support your tablet. Use the
following example when you edit your own XF86Config file:

##BEGIN COPY##

Section "Module"
        load    "xf86GtcoCC.so"
EndSection

Section "XInput"
        SubSection              "gtcocursor"
                Port            "/dev/ttyS0"
                DeviceName      "Tablet"
                Mode            Absolute
                DataFormat      GTCO_Type5
#               DataFormat      GTCO_CC
#               DataFormat      Summa_MM
#               DataFormat      Summa_UIOF
#               EmulateMouse    yes # default is no
#               BaudRate        19200 # default is 9600
                AlwaysCore
                MaxX            12000
                MaxY            12000
        EndSubSection
EndSection

##END COPY##


Device/Port
-----------

This is the serial port your tablet is plugged into.


DeviceName/Identifier
---------------------

This can be whatever you want.


DataFormat+BaudRate
-------------------

You must set these two values correctly for the type of tablet you have.

Mode
----

This may be Absolute or Relative.

If you select Absolute, each point on your tablet will be directly mapped
to one point on the screen.

If you select Relative, the screen cursor will move more like a mouse.


MaxX+MaxY
---------

This is the x and y size of your tablet in inches, times 1000. If you're
not sure how big your tablet is, use Absolute mode, then make a guess
here. If you can't use the entire area of your tablet to point, or if you
can't reach a section of the screen from your tablet, quit X, change MaxX
and MaxY, then restart X.


BUILDING
========

There is a separate file, BUILD, that describes building the driver.



MISC
====

Reconfiguring buttons
---------------------

If you are unhappy with the button layout of device, you can use the
xinput utility, written by Frederic Lepied, to remap the buttons. You
can obtain xinput at ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/utilities/xinput-1.2.tar.gz

To swap the first and second buttons, you'd use a command like this:

xinput set-button-map Tablet 2 1


Pressure support in The GIMP
----------------------------

If have a pressure tablet, but don't seem to be getting pressure in
pressure in The GIMP, you may need to rebuild Gtk+ with xinput support.

To add xinput support to Gtk+:
./configure --prefix=/usr --with-xinput=xfree

After rebuilding the Gtk+ library with xinput support, you must rebuild
The GIMP.

You must tell The GIMP to use your tablet in order to get it to recognize
pressure data. To do this, go into the "Input" dialog (available under
"File->Dialogs->InputDevices..."), and change the mode of the tablet
to "Screen" or "Window".

However, if you want to paint in The GIMP with a non-pressure pen or
cursor, then you must do one of two things. Either the tablet must be
disabled in the "Input" dialog, or you must enable the tablet in the
"Input" dialog but disable the "Pressure" axis.


Using the CadPro mouse
----------------------

To get the scrolling and proper button mapping for the CadPro mouse, you
must use the EmulateMouse option. See the sample snippets of XF86Config
for how to do this.


KNOWN BUGS
==========

- X may crash if the cursor or pen is resting on the tablet when X is
started.
