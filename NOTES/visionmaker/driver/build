To compile your own driver you will need the source 
code for XFree86, the driver source file (xf86GtcoCC.c) 
and the compile scripts (build-v3 or build-v4). Your 
system must also have gcc v2.96 or later, and ld v2.10.90
or later.

THIS DRIVER HAS BEEN TESTED WITH v4.0.1 SOURCE
The compile scripts have been tested against v4.1 
but ONLY the scripts not the driver itself.

Before you compile you must know which version of the 
XF86Config file your system uses. If you system uses 
version 3.x then you compile with the build-v3.sh script, 
if your system uses v4.x you compile with build-v4.sh.

To compile this driver you will need to edit the compile script.
You will need to tell the script where to find the source 
tree, this is set in the variable DIR. Simply change 
that to the absolute path to your source tree 
(see example).

example - change
DIR="./incl_dir"
 to
DIR="/usr/src/redhat/SOURCES"

If you are using a later version of gcc (>= ~2.96) you need to add
the "-fno-merge-constants" flag to the compile line by hand. Open the
build-v*.sh script and add this option to the parameters given to gcc.

The driver will still build if you need this option and you don't use
it, but X will crash when it tries to load the driver. You will see a 
bunch of errors that look something liked this:

  (II) Loading /usr/X11R6/lib/modules/input/gtcc_drv.o
  Not loading .rodata.str1.1

  Symbol .LC18 from module /usr/X11R6/lib/modules/input/gtcc_drv.o is unresolved!

If you see errors like that, use the "-fno-merge-constants" flag.
