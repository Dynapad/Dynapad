         xinput 1.x by Frederic Lepied <Frederic.Lepied@sugix.frmug.org>

1. Introduction
===============

xinput is an  utility  I have built  to  configure and test my  XInput
devices.    The functionalities aren't    complete  but  they fill  my
needs. If you have  some ideas or needs  for improvement, feel free to
contact me.  Any feedback welcome.

2. Requirements
===============

You'll need  an ANSI   C   compiler.  I  know   it works  under  Linux
ELF/XFree86 and Solaris 2.4 Sparc/X11R6.1.

3. Installation
===============

xmkmf -a
make install
make install.man
