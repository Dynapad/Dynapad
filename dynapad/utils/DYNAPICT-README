README FOR DYNAPICT

The dynapict.ss code wraps around drscheme's texpict collection to provide 
functionality for appending, aligning, and superimposing dynapad objects.


FUNCTIONS: APPENDING AND ALIGNING
vl-append-objs		(vertical-left)
vc-append-objs		(vertical-center)
vr-append-objs		(vertical-right)
ht-append-objs		(horiz-top)
hc-append-objs		(horiz-center)
hb-append-objs		(horiz-bottom)
htl-append-objs		(horiz top-baseline)
hbl-append-objs		(horiz bottom-baseline)

Each of the above functions take an optional int arg for gap-size, 
followed by an undetermined number of dynaobject args.

The htl and hbl functions align text objects using their baseline rather 
than the bounding box.  The hbl function is useful only when there are 
multiple lines of text in a text field.

Example:
	;; vertical-left append 3 objs with spacing of 5
	(vl-append-objs 5 obj1 obj2 obj3)

	;; horizontal top-baseline append a list of objects
	(apply htl-append-objs obj-list)


FUNCTIONS: SUPERIMPOSING
lt-superimpose-objs	(left-top)
lc-superimpose-objs	(left-center)
lb-superimpose-objs	(left-bottom)
ct-superimpose-objs	(center-top)
cc-superimpose-objs	(center-center)
cb-superimpose-objs	(center-bottom)
rt-superimpose-objs	(right-top)
rc-superimpose-objs	(right-center)
rb-superimpose-objs	(right-bottom)
ltl-superimpose-objs	(left top-baseline)
lbl-superimpose-objs	(left bottom-baseline)
rtl-superimpose-objs	(right top-baseline)
rbl-superimpose-objs	(right bottom-baseline)
ctl-superimpose-objs	(center top-baseline)
cbl-superimpose-objs	(center bottom-baseline)

Each of the above functions takes an undetermined number of dynaobject 
args.

The llast 6 functions align text objects using their baseline rather than 
bounding box, just like the append functions.

Example:
	;; Superimpose 3 dynapad objs at their right-bottom corners
	(rb-superimpose-objs obj1 obj2 obj3)
