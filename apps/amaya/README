Incomplete example of laying out a gesture transcript.

Assumes input file is tab separated.

starttime endtime lefthand righthand other speaker text

starttime and endtime are min:sec.

Meanings of lefthand/righthand/other gestures are built into the code.

Usage:

  (load "amaya.rkt")
  (define x (make-object transcript% "Amaya-example.txt"))

  (send x entries) ; returns list of entry% objects
  (send entry lh)
  (send entry text)
  etc

The layout is located at starttime in seconds times ten.
For example, 1:01 is located at (610 0 1).
