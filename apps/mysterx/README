Mysterx provide scheme access to COM objects.
Mysterx must be installed separately, see www.plt-scheme.org.

Here are some examples of mysterx:

  tracking urls from ie
  excel
  mediaplayer

The mediaplayer seems to require being hosted in an mx-browser.

I'm working on more complete examples.

See collects/mysterx/doc.txt and collects/mysterx/msdemo.ss.
There are also two postscript documents in www.plt-scheme.org.
