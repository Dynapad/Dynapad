Zoomable directory browser

Shows contents of given directory and recurses down to show contents
of all subdirectories.  An optional depth parameter limits the number 
of levels of recursion.

Usage:

   (load "directory-browser.ss")
   (define db (make-object dir-browser% currentPAD [path] [depth]))

Caution: Directories with a large number of contents such as /home/Share 
or /usr/bin may take a while to load... and could possibly crash Dynapad
if no depth level is specified.

Example:

   -- Draw subdirectories 2 levels deep	
   (define db (make-object dir-browser% currentPAD "/home/Share/testdir" 2))
	
   -- Draw contents of only one directory
   (define db (make-object dir-browser% currentPAD "/home/hci/dynapad" 0))

   -- Draw ALL recursive subdirectories
   (define db (make-object dir-browser% currentPAD "/home/Share/testdir"))

Opening/Closing Windows:

   A dir-window% is open when it displays its file icons and subdirectory 
   windows.  It is closed when it displays only a white rectangle.  To
   open a closed window, click inside it while pressing the Shift key.
   Do likewise to close an opened window.
   This is a useful feature for working with depth levels.

Navigation:

   Zoom into a directory window by clicking inside the window 
   excluding icons and sub-windows.

   Zoom back to a parent window by clicking outside the 
   currently centered window.

Selecting:

   Select a directory window by clicking on the title.

Applications:

   Double click on a file icon to open its associated application.
   - Text files  -> Emacs
   - Image files -> ImageMagick
   - PDF files   -> Acrobat Reader
   - URL files   -> Konqueror

Thermometer:
   
   Background colors symbolize icon's "temperature"
   Arbitrary scheme:
 	- Red = modified within last day
	- Yellow = modified within last week
	- Green = modified within last month
	- Blue = not modified for over 30 days
