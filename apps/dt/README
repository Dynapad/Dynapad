Subject: DiamondTouch and uberapp

I decided to create a clean user account on hoopla, get Dynapad and
uberapp running with the DiamondTouch table, and trace my steps.

build:
  check out Dynapad module from CVS and change to module directory
  build dynapad
    ./configure && make all
  build dt library and tools
    cd apps/dt && ./configure && make

run:
  start X with appropriate layout, on display :1 because :0 is in use
    startx -- :1 -layout dtclone
  start touchd
    ./apps/dt/touchd/touchd &
  start mred
    mred -z
  load dynapad
    (load "dynapad.ss")
  load uberapp
    (appload "uberapp")
  load the dt interface to uberapp
    (appload "dt-dynapad" "dt-buttons.ss")

I know many of these are standard steps, but I decided to err on the
side of completeness and specificity. I also spent some time simplifying
the process described above; a few steps previously required now aren't.
