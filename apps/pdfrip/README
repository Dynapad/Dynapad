Some images, extracted with pdfimages, were flipped about the X axis.

Unlike Xpdf, pdfimages (included with Xpdf) doesn't apply the CTM
(current transformation matrix) from the image dictionary, so some
extracted images are flipped.  (Why only some?  Perhaps because images
can be stored in different formats in PDFs; eg, JPEG versus ???.)

I modified padimages (ImageOutputDev.cc) to flip the image based on Sy from the CTM.

I notified the Xpdf maintainer about the problem and my fix, but haven't received
a response, so I don't know if the fix will be applied to the Xpdf distribution.
So, I'm including here a context diff and the patched ImageOutputDev.cc for
reference, in case the patch must be applied to future versions of Xpdf.
