Simple mysql interface.  You can use this directly, but I recommend
subclassing from mysql%.  See workspace.ss and worktest.ss for an
example of subclassing.

  (load-relative "/home/hci/dynapad/apps/mysql/worktest.rkt")

Environment variable DYNAHOME MUST BE SET, because mysql.ss and mysql.so
are installed in $DYNAHOME/lib.

Usage:

  (load (build-path (getenv "DYNAHOME") "lib" "mysql.rkt"))
  (define c (make-object mysql%))
  (send c connect "host" "user" "password")
  (send c database "test")
  (send c query "select * from table")
  (send c store_result)

If you get an error (return #f), you can obtain the error message with

  (send c error)

There are also slightly higher level methods:

  (send c select "* from table")
  (send c delete "from table where column = value")  returns affected_rows
  (send c update "...")  returns affected_rows
  (send c insert "into table values (value0, value1)  returns insert_id
  (send c insert_id)
  (send c affected_rows)

You might need to use mysql_escape_string to ensure that strings are
properly escaped for mysql.  See workspace.ss for an example.
