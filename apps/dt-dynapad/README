To run dt-dynapad apps, you'll need a working /dev/DiamondTouch device.
For now this is outside the scope of this document.

Let DYNAPAD be the Dynapad root directory. First build the dt libraries:

  $ (cd DYNAPAD/apps/dt/libdt && ./configure && make)

Then build touchd:

  $ (cd DYNAPAD/apps/dt/touchd && ./configure && make)

Then build the mzscheme extension for reading from touchd's socket:

  $ (cd DYNAPAD/apps/dt/mzdt && make)

Now start touchd, the daemon that reads raw signals from
/dev/DiamondTouch and offers the resulting processed "touch" information
to any interested clients on a UNIX-domain datagram socket. We'll run it
in the background:

  $ DYNAPAD/apps/dt/touchd/touchd &

Now you can run dt-dynapad apps. For example, to run dt-paint:

  $ mred -z

  > (load "DYNAPAD/dynapad.rkt")
  > (load "DYNAPAD/apps/dt-dynapad/dt-paint.rkt")
  #t

Voila!
