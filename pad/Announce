Pad++ is a substrate for developing zooming graphical interfaces.  It
is built as a widget for Tcl/Tk (an interpreted scripting language and
motif-compliant user interface library).  It is thus possible to
create complete applications writing only Tcl code (and no C/C++).
There is a sample drawing application written entirely in Tcl that
uses the Pad++ widget called PadDraw.

Pad++ currently runs on Windows95/NT and most Unix boxes including
SGI's, Sun's (SunOS and Solaris), Dec's, RS-6000's, HP's, and PC's
running Linux and FreeBSD.  To use it, just type: paddraw

There is documentation describing the Tcl interface to pad in the 
doc subdirectory.

To access the interpreter, run the pad script.  Alternately, run the
padwish executable in the appropriate bin subdirectory (i.e., 
bin-i586-Linux for Linux).  To do this, you must set three shell
environment variables:
  PADHOME      - Pad++ home directory
  TCL_LIBRARY  - Location of runtime Tcl libraries
  TK_LIBRARY   - Location of runtime Tk libraries
Then you can start the drawing application by executing this Tcl command:
"source draw/pad.tcl"

For more information about Pad++ and to download sources or pre-compiled
binaries for several architectures, see

Pad++ is available for free for non-commercial use including research, 
education, and in-house use.
