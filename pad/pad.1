.SH NAME
padwish \- Pad++ windowing shell
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpadwish\fR ?\fIoptions\fR? ?\fIarg arg ...\fR?
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB\-display \fIdisplay\fR" 15
Display (and screen) on which to display window.
.IP "\fB\-geometry \fIgeometry\fR" 15
Initial geometry to use for window.
.IP "\fB\-name \fIname\fR" 15
Use \fIname\fR as the title to be displayed in the window, and
as the name of the interpreter for \fBsend\fR commands.
.IP "\fB\-sync\fR" 15
Execute all X server commands synchronously, so that errors
are reported immediately.  This will result in much slower
execution, but it is useful for debugging.
.IP "\fB\-colormap \fIcolormap\fR" 15
Specifies the colormap that padwish should use.  If 
\fIcolormap\fR is "new", then a private colormap is
allocated for padwish, so images will look nicer
(although on some systems you get a distracting flash when you move the
pointer in and out of a PadDraw window and the global colormap is updated).
.IP "\fB\-visual \fIvisual\fR" 15
Specifies the visual type that padwish should use.  The valid
visuals depend on the X server you are running on.  Some common
useful ones are "truecolor 24" and "truecolor 12", which specify
24 bit and 12 bit mode, respectively.
.IP "\fB\-language\fR" 15
Specifies what scripting language the top-level interpreter 
should use.  Pad++ always supports Tcl, but can be compiled 
to use the Elk version of Scheme also.  In addition, Pad++
provides a mechanism to support other interpreted scripting 
languages as well.
.IP "\fB\-sharedmemory\fR" 15
Specifies if Pad++ should try and use X shared memory.
Some machines (notably a particular Solaris 5.4 machine)
crashes and the X server dies when Pad++ is used with shared
memory, so it can be disabled if there is trouble.
Defaults to 1 (true).
.IP "\fB\-help\fR" 15
Print a summary of the command-line options and exit.
.IP "\fB\-\-\fR" 15
Pass all remaining arguments through to the script's
argv variable without interpreting them.  This provides
a mechanism for passing arguments such as -name to a script
instead of having padwish interpret them.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBPadwish\fR is an extension to wish, the simple windowing shell
that comes with the standard distribution of Tcl/Tk.  The extension
includes a new pad widget.  The pad widget is similar to the canvas,
but supports many new features - primarily zooming.
.PP
\fBPadwish\fR creates a main window and then processes Tcl commands.
If \fBpadwish\fR is invoked with no \fB\-f\fR option then it
reads Tcl commands interactively from standard input.
It will continue processing commands until all windows have been
deleted or until end-of-file is reached on standard input.
.VS
If there exists a file \fB.padinit\fR in the home directory of
the user, \fBpadwish\fR evaluates the file as a Tcl script
just before reading the first command from standard input.
.VE
.PP
If the \fB\-file\fR option is provided to Tk, then \fBpadwish\fR reads Tcl
commands from the file named in the \fB\-file\fR option.  These
commands will normally create an interactive interface consisting
of one or more widgets.  When the end of the command file is
reached, \fBpadwish\fR will continue to respond to X events until
all windows have been deleted.
.VS
There is no automatic evaluation of \fB.padinit\fR in this
case, but the script file can always \fBsource\fR it if desired.
.VE

.SH "VARIABLES"
.PP
\fBPadwish\fR sets the following Tcl variables:
.TP 15
\fBargc\fR
Contains a count of the number of \fIarg\fR arguments (0 if none),
not including the options described above.
.TP 15
\fBargv\fR
Contains a Tcl list whose elements are the \fIarg\fR arguments (not
including the options described above), in order, or an empty string
if there are no \fIarg\fR arguments.
.TP 15
\fBargv0\fR
.VS
Contains \fIfileName\fR if it was specified.
Otherwise, contains the name by which \fBpadwish\fR was invoked.
.TP 15
\fBtcl_interactive\fR
Contains 1 if \fBpadwish\fR is reading commands interactively (no
\fB\-file\fR option was specified and standard input is a terminal-like
device), 0 otherwise.
.VE

.SH "SCRIPT FILES"
.PP
If you create a Tcl script in a file whose first line is
.DS
\fB#!/usr/local/bin/padwish -f
.DE
then you can invoke the script file directly from your shell if
you mark it as executable.
This assumes that \fBpadwish\fR has been installed in the default
location in /usr/local/bin;  if it's installed somewhere else
then you'll have to modify the above line to match.

.SH PROMPTS
.PP
.VS
When \fBpadwish\fR is invoked interactively it normally prompts for each
command with ``\fB% \fR''.  You can change the prompt by setting the
variables \fBtcl_prompt1\fR and \fBtcl_prompt2\fR.  If variable
\fBtcl_prompt1\fR exists then it must consist of a Tcl script
to output a prompt;  instead of outputting a prompt \fBpadwish\fR
will evaluate the script in \fBtcl_prompt1\fR.
The variable \fBtcl_prompt2\fR is used in a similar way when
a newline is typed but the current command isn't yet complete;
if \fBtcl_prompt2\fR isn't set then no prompt is output for
incomplete commands.
