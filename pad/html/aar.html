<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<P>
For many types of information retrieval, social interaction is
critical to the experience. For instance, why do people go to live
music concerts instead of listening to the CD? Partly because of the
different kind of sound, but I believe it is also largely due to the
social experience of being in an auditorium with the rest of the
audience. This identifies one area where I do not think Virtual
Reality will be successful. I believe that one of the biggest
challenges for today's technical design- ers is to develop ways that
computers can improve communication and interaction among people.
<P>

There are also times when it is appropriate to provide information
without replacing the world for practical reasons. For instance, when
giving traffic directions while driving, a typical approach is to put
video on the dashboard with a map application, or to supply a printed
piece of paper with directions. Both of these situations are
potentially dangerous because they overload the visual channel by
replacing it, at least temporarily.
<P>

One approach to these challenges is to use "Augmented Reality" - that
is, to superimpose computer generated data on top of the real world,
as the person moves within it. A number of groups are beginning to
experiment with this notion, notably Steve Feiner at Columbia. My work
is different in that it replaces the video augmentation that Feiner
uses with audio. As you interact with the world, you are provided with
relevant audio annotations which give you extra information about the
current situation without interrupting what you are doing. This works
by using a different and largely unused communication channel.
<P>

For a practical application based on this idea, it may be necessary
for the entire computer system to be carried around, and for the
computer system to know where it is in the environment. To gen-
eralize this research question, I have begun to ask "What happens when
a computer that you carry knows where it is?"
<P>

We have been applying these concepts by creating an automated tour
guide for museums. The sys- tem will automatically describe pieces in
the museum as they are approached. One advantage of this method over
traditional taped tours is that people will have the choice to choose
what they want to see, in what order, and for how long. We currently
have a prototype demonstrating this technology. This concept could
also be applied to the above mentioned traffic direction problem so
that the driver automatically gets verbal traffic commands such as
"turn right at the light" in situ.
<P>

I believe that Virtual Reality may be appropriate for certain kinds of
information visualization, such as architectural walkthroughs - which
can not be done any other way. However, it may not be able to replace
other kinds of information retrieval, such as museum tours. I believe
that this is due to the social aspect of the information retrieval
process. Virtual Reality takes people away from people.  It replaces
the natural environment with a virtual one - and the society inherent
in the natural one. Social situations in our physical world are
important in our educational, entertaining, and creative expe-
riences. It is one thing to replace social situations with technology,
but the real challenge is to use technology to enhance them.
