<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<P>
We have implemented an infinite resolution multimedia sketchpad as a
base for exploring a stream-of-consciousness model of computation
where information creating, sharing and retrieval becomes so intuitive
that the interface becomes invisible. Motivation to pursue this came
from work on Pad [4], which can be thought of as a kind of traditional
sketchpad or windows environment in the sense that it is a
general-purpose substrate for visualizing two dimensional graphics and
text. But Pad also supports the radical notion of being infinite in
extent and resolution.
<P>
We implemented Pad++ to explore smooth zooming for navigation and to
serve as a platform for multimedia authoring and information
visualization. The ability to work with very large datasets has been a
primary design consideration in the development of Pad++.

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<P>
The motivation for our work on multiscale interfaces is to move beyond
windows, icons, menus, and pointers to explore interfaces that more
effectively support navigation through complex sets of multimedia
information [1, 2, 5]. One premise of our work is the belief that
navigation in information spaces is best supported by tapping into our
natural spatial and geographic ways of thinking [3].
<P>
Information can be entered interactively by the user or dynamically by
a program on Pad++. It can be placed at any location and at arbitrary
scale. Navigation is performed by zooming in and out and moving around
the surface. Our metaphor for searching for information is that all
the information is there and to see more detail, you just have to take
a closer look. Using Pad is meant to feel like you have a gigantic
piece of paper that you can look at with a microscope with arbitrary
resolving power and smooth zooming.

<h2>RECENT ADVANCES</h2>
<P>
Our focus in this implementation has been to provide smooth zooming in
a system that works with very large datasets. The nature of the Pad++
interface requires consistent high frame-rate interactions, even as
the dataspace becomes large and the scene gets complicated. In many
applications, speed is important, but not critical to functionality.
In Pad++, however, the interface paradigm is inherently based on
interaction. The searching strategy is to visually explore the
dataspace, so it is essential that interactive frame rates be
maintained.
<P>

We implemented Pad++ in C++ on Silicon Graphics computers using SGI's
graphics language facilities (the GL) to provide smooth zooming. We
wrote a standard set of drawing widgets to enter text, lines,
squiggles, etc., to load files and images, and a standard set of
operators such as grouping, copying, deleting, etc. These give a
multimedia author the basic tools for creating a dataspace.
<P>

In order to keep the animation frame-rate up as the dataspace size and
complexity increases, we implemented several standard efficiency
methods, which taken together create a powerful system. We are able to
load in over 600,000 objects and maintain interactive rates. Briefly,
these methods are:
<P>

<ul>
<li>Spatial Indexing: Create a hierarchy of objects based on bounding
boxes to quickly index to visible objects.

<li>Spatial Level-Of-Detail: Render only the detail needed, do not
spend time rendering what can not be seen.

<li>Clipping: Only render the portions of objects that are actually
visible.

<li>Refinement: Render fast with low resolution while navigating and
refine the image when still.

<li>Adaptive Render Scheduling: Keep the zooming rate constant even
as the frame rate changes.
</ul>

<P>

One challenge in navigating through any large dataspace is maintaining
a sense of relationship between what you are looking at and where it
is with respect to the rest of the data. The rough animation or jumpy
zooming as implemented in the original Pad [4] can be disorienting and
thus not provide the most effective support for the cognitive and
perceptual processing required for interactive information
visualization and navigation. We implemented smooth zooming where
pressing the middle button zooms in and pressing the right button
zooms out (the left button is a context-dependent button). Pressing
either of the zoom buttons once and holding it initiates the zooming
which starts slowly and accelerates according to a profile specified
by the maximum zooming speed and how long it takes to reach that
speed. Holding the middle and right buttons permit panning.
<P>

An important interactive interface issue when accessing external
information sources is how to give the user access to them without
incurring substantial start-up costs while the database is parsed and
loaded. In Pad++ this is accomplished with parallel lazy loading: only
load the portion of the database that is visible in the current view.
As the user navigates through the database and looks at new areas,
those portions of the database are loaded. This lazy loading is done
in the background so the user can continue to interact with Pad++, and
when the loading is complete, items appear in the appropriate place.

<h2>SAMPLE APPLICATION</h2>
<P>

We built a Pad++ directory browser to explore how smooth zooming and
the various efficiency mechanisms help in viewing a large hierarchical
database. The Pad++ directory browser provides a graphical interface
for accessing the directory structure of a filesystem [Figure 1]. Each
directory is represented by a square pink frame, and files are
represented by solid squares colored by file type (Figure 1 is B & W).
Both directories and files show their filenames as labels when the
user is sufficiently close to be able to read them. Each directory has
all of its subdirectories and files organized alphabetically inside of
it. Searching through the directory structure involves only zooming in
and out of the directory tree. Zooming into a file automatically loads
the text inside the colored square and it can then be edited and
annotated.

<P>

We are able to load in a directory tree with over 600,000 objects, and
maintain interactive animation rates of about 10 frames per second.
Spatial indexing allows us to maintain a very large database while
keeping the search time fast, since we render only the visible
portion. While navigating with Pad++, very small objects are not drawn
and larger ones are drawn with reduced resolution. The reduced
resolution objects are refined when the user stops changing the view.

<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
<P>

We implemented Pad++, a multimedia multiscale hierarchical sketchpad,
focusing on efficiency and expandability. By implementing several
efficiency mechanisms which act in concert, we are able to maintain
high frame-rate interaction with very large databases.
<P>

We are currently, in collaboration with NYU, beginning to design an
end user language for application authoring. In addition, we also are
exploring several application domains, such as history-enriched
digital objects, as part of the continued development of Pad++.

<P>

We would like to acknowledge other members of the Computer Graphics
and Interactive Media Research Group at Bellcore for many discussions
shared during our search for the best cheeseburger. We also would like
to thank Ken Perlin and his students, David Fox and Matthew Fuchs, at
NYU for enjoyable discussions and for seeding out interest in
multiscale interfaces.
