<H1>Ben Bederson's Alaska Travel Story</H1><P>
I flew to Anchorage and within 24 hours, my brother Geoff and I were in
the plane again up to Barrow. We landed in a fog with a balmy 35
degrees and strong wind from the North. We gritted our teeth. The next
day, we met our old friends, got prepared, and got the latest word on
the tundra. Heard that it was wet. We'd have a lot of rivers to cross
and that we were out of our minds. Fortunately, we had our nice pile
clothes, new down/gortex parkas, and we had bought a 3 1/2 pound
inflatable raft along with 500 feet of parachute cord for crossing
rivers. We had a 1 1/2 pound .22 pistol, one can each of cayenne paper
bear repellent good at 35 feet, and 27 pounds each of food. We figured
9 days of hiking plus 3 emergency days of food at 2 1/4 pounds per day
to be on the safe side since it would probably be ridiculously cold.
Thinking about hiking in marshes, we gave up hiking boots and got 18
inch high water boots. Our packs totalled 72 pounds.  
<P>
The first day was pathetic. Somehow, we didn't get out until 4pm - not
having our instructors to hurry us along in the morning. We planned on
hiking along the beach for 12 miles that day to the Will Rogers and
Wiley Post memorial - the site where they crashed about 50 years ago
or so exploring the arctic by plane for the first time. I was so
excited that our trip was flat - at sea level with all that nice thick
oxygen, I thought it would be a breeze. Well, I neglected to calculate
that each step on the soft sand on the beach pushed away about 3
inches of sand - meaning that I had to climb 3 inches on the next
step. And this happened every step.  I calculated that 12 miles at 3
feet per step with 3 inches elevation gain per step works out to about
5000 feet vertical elevation gain. But at least we'd have plenty of
water, we thought, crossing at least 3 rivers emptying into the ocean.
They were all dry.  Half way there, we were so tired, Geoff and I
would look at each other and would see each others tortured looks and
break up into hysterics.  My mouth was so dry, I couldn't eat
anything, and we just got weaker and weaker. But we were driven to get
to the monument because it was right next to a huge lagoon. Finally,
we arrived at the lagoon at around midnight, ran to the lagoon and I
could honestly say that we were slightly disappointed to find out that
it was salt water!!! We set up our tents. The sun was setting, and
went onto the tundra in search of water. The 1955 map showed some tiny
lakes a half mile inland.  Searching around awhile, we found one.
Beautiful. 20 feet long.  Crystal clear smooth surface. Only one
problem. It turned about to be only 1mm deep with no way of extracting
any water without a huge amount of muck. Kept on searching to find
anotherlake - this one deeper. Filled our water jugs, and were so
disgusted by the thick brown goopy water that we looked at each other,
grunted, and threw out the water. Searched some more, and after about
45 minutes of water-hunting, finally found some not too thick, yellow
water.  Two pills, 30 minute wait in the cold, and we drank. Ate some
macs and cheese, and went to bed at 2am.  It was getting dark.  
<P>
After that, the trip was easy. We ate two pounds of food and were
happy to carry our packs, nice and light at 70 pounds. We turned
inland and were on the tundra!  The tundra is an amazing and beautiful
place. At first glance, you might think it is empty, but you start to
look closer and you see so much life, and so much color and texture,
it becomes at least as beautiful as any mountain range we saw in
Wyoming.  The tundra comes in all kind of varieties. Small lakelets.
3 mile long huge clean lakes. Marsh. Thick bog. Dried out flat lake
beds - either black and muddy, or grassy. The entire trip was under
100 feet of elevation, so although our topo maps weren't too useful
with that, they showed the bigger lakes fairly accurately. There were
higher, dryer sections of tundra 5 or 10 feet up that we would usually
walk on. The lower stuff was too soft and wet. The high ground has
surface unlike anything else I have ever seen on this planet. I can
only describe the land in Dr. Seuss' books. There are hummocks which
are little hills, 3 or 5 feet high, and maybe 10 feet in diameter.
The hummocks, strangely enough, are all polygonal. That is, there
sides are all straight. It turns out they are formed by cracks in the
permafrost (frozen ground) which form in straight lines. On the
hummocks are tussocks which are little lumps of grass growing on lumps
of dirt. They are often top heavy, and you tend to slip off of them.
Sometimes, there are even tussocks on tussocks (on hummocks on
tundra).  
<P>
The next days, we hiked about 10 miles a day in about 10 hours each.
The tundra was even harder to walkon than the beach, as it was very
soft and springy. Fortunately, once we got inland, there was plenty of
water and I would hike with my water bottle empty - filling it up at
rest steps, waiting 20 minutes and drinking on the spot. 10 miles
inland, we began to see caribou.  They were one of the highlights of
the trip. Caribou look kind of like deer-sized moose.  They are very
friendly and playful. They hardly ever walk, preferring to run around.
They are basically bouncy creatures. The little ones were quite
curious, often coming within 10 feet of us to say hello.  As the
trip progressed, so did the caribou.  There were times when you
couldn't look around without seeing a caribou somewhere.  
<P>

On the fourth day, we got to the Inaru River, and found a spot where
it was only 75 feet wide (but over our heads). We very easily crossed
it with our raft, using the string to pull our packs across on it. The
weather cleared up and we had an arctic indian summer. It was sunny,
the wind died down, and temperature was in the 50's. 
<P>

After the first day of hiking in layers of pile, it was wonderful to
hike in shorts and a t-shirt. After crossing the river, we decided it
was time to split up.  Geoff stayed, and I hiked another 6 miles that
day by myself. At first, it was a very strange feeling being alone on
the tundra. I could see quite far (especially standing on a hummock)
in every direction and there was nothing. I was definitely alone. At
first, I was too nervous to stop, so I hiked those six miles with only
one short rest stop. Then the next day we had decided that we would
both take a rest day. I was exhausted and very ready for it. I woke
up, ate breakfast, and slept all day in the sun. Then I woke up, ate
dinner, and went to sleep for the night. The next day I felt better
and went on.
<P>

Well, this description is getting somewhat longer than I expected.
Basically, I made it the rest of the way to itAtqusak with no problems
(except getting a little tired sometimes). Atqusak is a very small
village (about 150 people) with a 30 million dollar school - so that's
where we went to warm up. As you might imagine, it's not every day
that someone walks into Atqusak from the tundra. So within about a
half hour, every single person in town knew who we were, and many
people came by to chat. The plane couldn't get in that day because of
low fog, but we flew out the next day.  
<P>

Back to Barrow for one more quick adventure. We borrowed
three-wheelers (souped up fat-tire all-terrain vehicles) from some
friends and rode about 40 miles along the shore in search of some clay
cliffs that the Eskimos used traditionally (mostly to trade with the
indians). We found a huge amount of very high quality gray clay, 65
pounds of which I brought back to Barrow and shipped to New York. The
real highlight of that trip, however, was my discovery of a gigantic
clean and bleached whale rib washed up on shore. It probably is from a
Bowhead whale killed by the Eskimos, and is at least 5 feet tall. I
carried it on my shoulder the last 15 miles back to Barrow and took it
back with me to New Jersey. We also found an entire spine of a whale.
With much difficulty, we cut off some vertebrae, and we each took one.
Mine is on its way here now via the post office where I plan on using
it for a chair - it's quite big!
<P>

P.S. I forgot one adventure in our tundra trip. The time we were
walking through a marsh - trying to step on the grass tufts to stay on
top. Well, one time there was no more grass and I tried walking on top
of the mud.  Big mistake. I immediately got slurped into the thick and
oozy muck. As I was sinking I wondered if this was going to be my
fate: fossilized Benjy in a bog. Fortunately, I hit the permafrost and
stopped sinking - about 1/2 inch to go before it went over the tops of
my boots! It was so thick, I could barely turn around, ;but I did,
just barely manage to keep my boots on my feet!
