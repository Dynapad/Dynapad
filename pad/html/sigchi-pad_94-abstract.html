<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<P>
We have implemented an infinite resolution multimedia sketchpad as a
base for exploring a stream-of-consciousness model of computation
where information creating, sharing and retrieval becomes so intuitive
that the interface becomes invisible. Motivation to pursue this came
from work on Pad [4], which can be thought of as a kind of traditional
sketchpad or windows environment in the sense that it is a
general-purpose substrate for visualizing two dimensional graphics and
text. But Pad also supports the radical notion of being infinite in
extent and resolution.
<P>
We implemented Pad++ to explore smooth zooming for navigation and to
serve as a platform for multimedia authoring and information
visualization. The ability to work with very large datasets has been a
primary design consideration in the development of Pad++.
