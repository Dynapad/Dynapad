       Welcome to PadDraw.


PadDraw is a sample application
written on top of Pad++.  It is
meant to fulfill three goals:
  * Demonstrate Pad++ functionality
  * Provide sample code for others
    learning to use Pad++.
  * Be a testbed for Pad++

PadDraw is written entirely in Tcl.

PadDraw is a basic drawing
program and comes with several
demonstrations of small
applications written in Pad++.

The demonstrations can all be
accessed via the "Demo" menu.

Navigating within PadDraw
-------------------------

Moving around is accomplished
with the mouse buttons.

Left:   Mode dependent
        (See Drawing Tools)
Middle: Zoom In
Right:  Zoom Out

The hand in the Drawing
Tool allows Panning 
(Moving left/right/up/down).

However, holding the *control*
key allows panning no matter
what mode is active.
