To compile Pad++ on Windows95 or NT, you must follow these steps.
You must have Microsoft Visual C++ Version 4.x

1. Build tcl7.6/tk4.2 
   1.1 Get Winzip32 or gnu tools 
   1.2 Get tcl7.6.tar.gz and tk4.2.tar.gz from ftp://ftp.sunlabs.com/pub/tcl
   1.3 Extract the files into \tcl7.6 and \tk4.2
       Use 'gunzip tcl7.6.tar.gz |tar xvf -' 
       or use winZip32 tools to unzip the file and extract the files.
   1.4 Replace the tk4.2\win\rc directory with pad\win\rc directory.
       This is necessary to allow access to the Pad++ cursors.
       You can do this by renaming the tk4.2\win\rc directory
       to something like origrc, and then copying pad\win\rc
       into tk4.2\win.
   1.5 Replace the file tk4.2\win\stubs.c with the version in
       pad\win\stubs42.c.  This is necessary to complete Tk's
       emulation of X.
   1.6 Build Tcl and Tk with the following commands:
       cd \tcl7.6\win
       nmake -f Makefile.vc

       cd \tk4.2\win
       nmake -f Makefile.vc

2. Build Pad++
   2.1 Edit pad/win/makefile and change of the paths at the beginning
       of the makefile to describe where components are on your system.
   2.2 Compile Pad++ with:
          cd pad/win
          nmake
